# Ex1-image-processing

## Histogram equalization, Optimal image quantization, Gamma Correction

My Python version: 3.8.2

My platform: PyCharm

All the files:

ex1_utils.py: A file that contains the following functions that perform operations on images:

imReadAndConvert: Loading grayscale and RGB image representations

imDisplay: Displaying the images

transformRGB2YIQ: Transforming RGB color images to the YIQ color space

transformYIQ2RGB: Conversion in the other direction

hsitogramEqualize: Performing intensity transformations - histogram equalization

quantizeImage: Performing optimal quantization

gamma.py: File that including a function that performs gamma correction on an image with a given Î³

gammaDisplay: GUI for gamma correction (with slide to change the brightness)

test.py: Tester I wrote to test all functions on ex1_utils file

ex1_main.py: Tester of the lecturer to test all the the functions
